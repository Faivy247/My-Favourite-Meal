        <p>Name of Food: Porridge Yam</p>
        <h2>A Little Info About My Favourite Meal</h2>
        <p>Porridge yam is also known as pottage yam, and it is prepared in other parts of Africa other than Nigeria. I believe other African countries have their history about the food.</p>
        <p>Yam porridge is a delicious Nigerian yam dish cooked in a well-seasoned oil and pepper mix until soft and fluffy with some yam chunks. Some times fish and vegatables are added to make different porridge yam flavours</p>
